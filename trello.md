## User Stories

-   As a developer adding tasks to Trello, you should always look at the tasks from the lens of the end user.

**As a **\_\_\_\_**,** ‚Üê persona - who will be using this feature?

**I want **\_\_\_\_**,** ‚Üê feature - describe the feature.

**so that \*\***\_\***\*.** ‚Üê need - describe the need.

_Example:_ **As a potential customer,** **I want to see a landing page** that has replaces all Lorem Ipsum placeholder text replaced with actual text that explains what this app does **so that I have real explanations** of what the app does.

## Keeps Tasks Small

-   User stories should be broken down into granular tasks that can generally be done in a day or less.

    -   As a developer I need to implement knex and setup a knexfile in the root of the app so that I have a way to write migrations.
    -   As a developer I need to write migration for the database so that have table for in the database for

        _Checklist:_

        -   [ ] Table one
        -   [ ] Table two
        -   [ ] Table three
        -   [ ] Table four

    -   As a developer I need to write endpoints so the client can access the API so that unique data can be served to the front end.

        _Checklist:_

        -   [ ] Endpoint one
        -   [ ] Endpoint two
        -   [ ] Endpoint three
        -   [ ] Endpoint four
