# How to use Trello

## User Stories

-   As a developer adding tasks to Trello, you should always look at the tasks from the lens of the end user.

    _Example:_ As a user I want to see a landing page that has replaces all Lorem Ipsum placeholder text with actual text that explains what this app does.

## Keeps Tasks Small

-   User stories should be broken down into granular tasks that can generally be done in a day or less.

    ### _Bad example:_ As a user I want my app to have a backend.

    ### _Good Example:_

    -   As a developer I need initial node/express boiler plate setup and pass a sanity check in postman
    -   As a user I need to implement knex and setup a knexfile in the root of the app
    -   As a developer I need to write the migrations for the database.

        _Checklist:_

        -   [ ] Table one
        -   [ ] Table two
        -   [ ] Table Three
        -   [ ] Table four

    -   As a developer I need to write endpoints so the client can access the API.

        _Checklist:_

        -   [ ] Endpoint one
        -   [ ] Endpoint two
        -   [ ] Endpoint Three
        -   [ ] Endpoint four
